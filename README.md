# CGNS to ASCII converter
A very simple aonversor of 2D cgns files. This guy, until now, managed TRI_3, QUAD_4 and MIXED element types. The boundary conditions and connectivity are outputed for my code but are easily availiable inside the code.

Just one argument (the cgns file) is needed. Take care, the correct format supported is cgns 2.4 node based grid. 

This code uses CGNS Mid-Level library and the learning process was very fun.
